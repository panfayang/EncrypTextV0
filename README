This app extends Caesar Cipher. Instead of a single integer defining the number of rotations of 
all the characters, the simples key has two dimensions: the starting index and the number of 
rotations. The app can generate up to ten simples keys in a row with different starting indices 
and different numbers of rotations and combine these ten keys to make a key that is way harder 
to find out by brutal force. 

Currently, this app can only decrypt/encrypt texts in English language, as the internal rotation 
uses ASCII ordering as numberical representation of every character. For any character that is 
not in ASCII, it will not be encrypted or decrypted.

The user should add keys with unique names. When the user wishes to encrypt/decrypt, the app will 
pop out an AlertDialog asking for the name of the key. If the name exists in the database of saved 
keys, the key associated with that name will be the key for encryption/decryption.
